# Counting to 3

**Setup**

Divide the group into duo's. In dividing an assignment to stir things up can be given, for example find the one you find the most stupid/fun within 10 seconds.

**Exercise**

Each duo has to count to 3 together. So A says 1, B says 2, A says 3, B says 1 and so forth. Try to get to a high pace. Participants should stop being in their head and don't think about it. 

After a while add a first variation. Switch the number 1 for a gesture for example raising your right hand. This means the order will be: Right hand, 2, 3, Right Hand, 2 and so forth.

Keep varying until all numbers are switched for a gesture. Again, it's about speed. People need to get out of their head and stop thinking about it.
