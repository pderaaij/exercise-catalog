# Nightmare Competitor

Imagine someone will come into your life who can do exactly what you can, but much better. It's the worst competitor you can imagine, it's your 2.0 version. The goal of this exercise is to find the things you can grow upon. To find what you can use to set goals for.

**Setup**

An important factor for this exercise is that there is trust in the group. To make this work people need to know each other and are not afraid to hold back. This won't work if people talk in nuance and subtilities, it has to be honest and direct feedback. 

Make groups of three, four or five. The exercise is easier if there are more than two people that have to give feedback. For each person take 10 minutes to receive feedback and 5 minutes to reflect on that feedback.

**Exercise**

Each round one person is the subject. This person takes a bit of distance and only listens. The others are going to describe the nightmare competitor of this person. They speak freely and preferably without thinking and holding back. Just speak, it's not about being right or wrong. It also helps the conversation going. By simply getting your thoughts out you help the process of others.

Some questions to help think about the Nightmare Competitor:

* What would customers say about this competitor?
* How would this competitor behave, what would be its character?
* Would this competitor be a leader of has it's own company?
* What would drive this competitor?

During these 10 minutes the subject takes notes and listen carefully. He or she is silent and not actively participating in the conversation of the others. After those 10 minutes the subject has 5 minutes to reflect on what has been said. What are elements the subject can work on to beat this nightmare competitor.
